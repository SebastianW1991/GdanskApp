Simple Historical Guide to Gda≈Ñsk created with React Native
The main reason I started to make this guide is to share my knowledge about history of my city.
It is still far from completness and I plan to do some bigger amount of work in few months when I will be able to do som good photos.


Unlike most guides I have seen so far, this one will cover not only touristic center,
but also some forgotten, yet very interesting districts. I plan to add many informations about everyday history. 
What did they eat, or how did they spend free time
